        I&apos;m a full-stack software engineer who leans toward the frontend. I
        love to create intuitive interfaces paired with proper guidance. I
        appreciate well-documented and efficient processes that offer both
        structure and flexibility. I value clear and kind communication,
        creativity, cross-functional collaboration, and supportive environments
        that foster diversity and nurture growth. Optimism guides my efforts
        while practicality ensures that my goals are brought to fruition.
        Helping others brings me great joy.
